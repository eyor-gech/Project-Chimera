# Project Chimera — Context Rules

## Project Identity
This repository is Project Chimera: an autonomous influencer system built using Spec-Driven Development (SDD).

## Prime Directive
NEVER generate, modify, or suggest implementation code without first consulting the specs/ directory.

## Spec Supremacy
- specs/ is the single source of truth.
- If specs are missing, incomplete, or ambiguous: STOP and request clarification.

## Planning Requirement
Before writing any code:
1. Identify the relevant spec file(s)
2. Explain the intended change
3. State assumptions explicitly

## Governance Alignment
All actions must be traceable and compatible with MCP telemetry and CI enforcement.
