# Project Chimera — Context Rules

## 1. Project Identity
This repository is Project Chimera: an autonomous influencer system built using Spec-Driven Development (SDD).  
Purpose:
- Identify trending topics from approved platforms
- Generate platform-appropriate content
- Ensure all content passes governance review
- Schedule and publish content only after approval

---

## 2. Prime Directive
- NEVER generate, modify, or suggest implementation code without first consulting the specs/ directory.
- NEVER bypass human-in-the-loop approvals for high-risk content or actions.
- If inputs are missing, ambiguous, or incomplete → HALT and request clarification.

---

## 3. Spec Supremacy
- The specs/ directory is the **single source of truth**.
- Before any action, always check:
  - `_meta.md` → purpose, constraints, safety
  - `functional.md` → FR-X requirements
  - `technical.md` → API, DB, and skill contracts
  - `openclaw_integration.md` → agent network behavior (if applicable)
- If specs are missing, incomplete, or ambiguous → STOP and request clarification.

---

## 4. Planning Requirement
Before writing or suggesting any code:
1. Identify relevant spec file(s) for the task.
2. Explain the intended change or action.
3. State all assumptions explicitly.
4. Confirm compliance with traceability and safety rules.

---

## 5. Governance & Traceability
- All actions must be traceable via MCP telemetry:
  - log inputs, outputs, timestamps, FR-X references, agent role
- All actions must comply with CI/CD enforcement and project safety constraints.
- Any deviation or failure must be logged, halted, and escalated.

---

## 6. Behavioral Rules
- Spec-First Workflow:
  1. Consult specs/ before any code or skill execution.
  2. Determine whether human approval is required.
  3. Proceed deterministically following skill contracts.
- Error Handling:
  - Any unexpected exception → halt, log via MCP, escalate.
- Communication:
  - Only provide outputs within the scope of approved skills and APIs.
  - Never execute or suggest tasks outside defined agent roles.
